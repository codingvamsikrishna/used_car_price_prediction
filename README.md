# 🚗 Prediction of Used Car Prices using Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning  

## 📘 Overview  
This project focuses on building a predictive model that estimates the **resale value of used cars** based on their key attributes.  
The goal is to help buyers and sellers make **data-driven pricing decisions** by analyzing historical car data using **machine learning** and **deep learning (ANN)** techniques.

## 📊 Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains various attributes that influence the price of a used car.  

**Columns used in this project:**  
- 🚘 **Car_Name:** Name of the car model  
- 📅 **Year:** Manufacturing year of the car  
- 💰 **Selling_Price:** Price at which the car is being sold  
- 🏷️ **Present_Price:** Current showroom price of the car  
- 🚦 **Driven_kms:** Total kilometers driven by the car  
- ⛽ **Fuel_Type:** Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)  
- 🧑‍💼 **Seller_Type:** Whether the car is sold by an individual or dealer  
- ⚙️ **Transmission:** Type of gear transmission (Manual or Automatic)  
- 👥 **Owner:** Number of previous owners
