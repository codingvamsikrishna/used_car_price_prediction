**🚗 Prediction of Used Car Prices using Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning**

**📘Overview**


This project focuses on building a predictive model that estimates the resale value of used cars based on their key attributes. The goal is to help buyers and sellers make data-driven pricing decisions by analyzing historical car data using machine learning and deep learning techniques.


📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains various attributes that affect the price of a used car.
Columns used in this project:

Car_Name: Name of the car model.

Year: Manufacturing year of the car.

Selling_Price: Price at which the car is being sold.

Present_Price: Current showroom price of the car.

Driven_kms: Total kilometers driven by the car.

Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG).

Seller_Type: Whether the car is sold by an individual or dealer.

Transmission: Type of gear transmission (Manual or Automatic).
