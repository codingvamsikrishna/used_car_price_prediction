**🚗 Prediction of Used Car Prices using Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning**

**📘Overview**

This project focuses on building a predictive model that estimates the resale value of used cars based on their key attributes. The goal is to help buyers and sellers make data-driven pricing decisions by analyzing historical car data using machine learning and deep learning techniques.


**📊 Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains various attributes that affect the price of a used car.
Columns used in this project:

**Car_Name**: Name of the car model.

**Year**: Manufacturing year of the car.

**Selling_Price**: Price at which the car is being sold.

**Present_Price**: Current showroom price of the car.

**Driven_kms**: Total kilometers driven by the car.

**Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG).

**Seller_Type**: Whether the car is sold by an individual or dealer.

**Transmission**: Type of gear transmission (Manual or Automatic).

**Owner**: Number of previous owners.

**🧠 Project Workflow**

**1.Data Collection**: Collected dataset from Kaggle and cleaned missing or irrelevant data.

**2.Data Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical columns.

**3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized feature relationships and price trends.

**4.Model Building**: Trained models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and ANN.

**5.Model Evaluation**: Compared model performance using R² score, MSE, and accuracy metrics.

**6.Prediction**: Predicted selling prices for unseen car data with the best-performing model.

**⚙️ Tech Stack**

**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

**Tools Used**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

**📈 Results**

-->The ANN model achieved the highest prediction accuracy compared to traditional ML models.

-->The model can predict used car prices with around 90–92% accuracy.

**💡 Key Features**

-->User-friendly and interpretable model predictions.

-->Handles both categorical and numerical features efficiently.

-->Visual representation of data trends and prediction performance.
